**Water Level Detector**  

**Objective**:  
Develop a water level monitoring system that provides real-time information on water levels in containers, tanks, or reservoirs, with a visual display and an audible alert for overflow prevention.  

**Overview**:  
- **Monitoring System**: Utilizes electronic sensors, a microcontroller, and a 7-segment display to indicate water levels (0 to 9).  
- **Alert Mechanism**: Incorporates a buzzer to notify users when the water level reaches the highest point, preventing overflow.  
- **Applications**: Suitable for industrial, agricultural, and domestic water management.  

**Implementation**:  
- Designed and assembled a circuit including a priority encoder, hex inverter, and BCD-to-7-segment decoder.  
- Developed and tested on breadboards, followed by PCB implementation for final design.  

**Results**:  
- Successfully demonstrated real-time water level detection and reliable alerts.  
- Achieved energy efficiency and user-friendly operation.  

**Future Scope**:  
- Wireless connectivity for remote monitoring.  
- Integration with IoT platforms and mobile applications.  
- Multiple container monitoring and predictive analysis using machine learning.  

**Cost**:  
- Total implementation cost: **Tk. 945**.
